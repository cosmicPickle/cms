CMS
===


This is a Content Management System that consist of a server API build on [PHP Fat Free Framework](http://fatfreeframework.com) and a frontend application build with [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org). This means, ofcourse that you would probably like to get acquainted with those two first if you haven't already.

Application workflow
--------------------

If you are only interested in using the **CMS** you can probably skip this part. If you want to develop modules, however, I strongly recommend reading through in order to get a feeling of how the application works.
